# Coursera Video Downloader Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet adds functionality to [Coursera](http://coursera.org)'s Video Lectures page to download and organize multiple videos at once with curl.

The bookmarklet generates bash code that can be entered directly into the command line and will download the selected videos sequentially. The videos are organized in the following structure:

    1. Introduction - Why Model?/
       1. Why Model?.mp4
       2. Intelligent Citizens of the World.mp4
       ...
    2. Segregation and Peer Effects/
    ...

## Notes

<a name="why_github_pages"></a>*Why do I have to navigate to this project's [GitHub Page](http://shivanker.github.com/Coursera-Video-Downloader-Bookmarklet) before installing the bookmark?*

The  GitHub-flavored markdown renderer on [this project's repo page](https://github.com/christiangenco/Coursera-Video-Downloader-Bookmarklet) doesn't allow inline javascript, which is how the bookmark functions, so the simple "drag-and-drop" into your bookmarks bar doesn't work. GitHub pages allow this.
